These are the testcases that exercise the TSS stack. They can be run
either through the the LTP framework or standalone.  The testcases have been 
tested against the 20040304 version of LTP.

Please do not execute these testcases on a machine on which you are actively 
using the TPM. For the testcases to execute properly the owner passphrase
must be entered into tcg/common/common.h which is insecure.

These testcases must be run on a machine with a 1.1 TPM and the TrouSerS
TSS. Boot the machine and clear the TPM ownership. Edit tcg/common/common.h
and enter the desired passphrases for the keys (KEY_PWD, OWN_PWD, and 
ENCDATA_PWD). Make the testcases and execute 
	tcg/highlevel/Tspi_TPM_TakeOwnership01
Now execute the testcases in the desired manner. 

To run standalone:
	1) cd tcg
	2) make
	3) cd ..
	4) ./tsstests.sh

To integrate with LTP:

To run these testcases 
	1) Download and expand LTP
	2) Obtain testcases from CVS (or other package).
	3) Copy the tcg directory into <ltp>/testcases
	4) Apply the Makefile patch 
	5) make
	6) make install
	7) ./runalltests.sh -f </full/path/to/ltp>/runtest/tcg -l ./logfile -p
