These are the testcases that exercise the TSS stack. They can be run
either through the the LTP framework or standalone.  The testcases have been
tested against the 20040304 version of LTP.

Please do not execute these testcases on a machine on which you are actively
using the TPM. For the testcases to execute properly the owner passphrase
must be entered into tcg/common/common.h which is insecure.

These testcases must be run on a machine with a 1.1 TPM and the TrouSerS
TSS. Boot the machine and clear the TPM ownership. Edit tcg/common/common.h
and enter the desired passphrases for the keys (KEY_PWD, OWN_PWD, and
ENCDATA_PWD). Defaults that are already in place will work fine.  To run
the testsuite, the TPM must be enabled, active and owned. To take
ownership of your TPM using a testcase, run the following:

$ testsuite/tcg/highlevel/tpm/Tspi_TPM_TakeOwnership01 -v 1.1

To build and run the testsuite:

Standalone:
	1) cd tcg
	2) make
	3) cd ..
	4) ./tsstests.sh

Integrated with the LTP:
	1) Download and expand LTP
	2) Obtain testcases from CVS (or other package).
	3) Copy the tcg directory into <ltp>/testcases
	4) Apply the Makefile patch
	5) make
	6) make install
	7) ./runalltests.sh -f </full/path/to/ltp>/runtest/tcg -l ./logfile -p
