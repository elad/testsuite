These are the testcases that exercise the TSS stack. They can be run
either through the the LTP framework or standalone.  The testcases have been
tested against the 20040304 version of LTP.

Please do not execute these testcases on a machine where you are actively
using the TPM.

These testcases must be run on a machine with a TPM and a TSS. Boot the
machine and take ownership of your TPM.  If you have the tpm-tools package,
you can run tpm_takeownership to take ownership of your TPM and set the owner
and SRK passwords.  If you don't have tpm-tools, run the following test case
to set the owner and SRK passwords (after building the testsuite):

$ testsuite/tcg/highlevel/tpm/Tspi_TPM_TakeOwnership01 -v 1.1

This test will set the owner and SRK passwords to the value of the environment
variables TESTSUITE_OWNER_SECRET and TESTSUITE_SRK_SECRET, respectively. During
the testsuite run, you will need to either set these environment variables to
their correct values, or change their values explicitly in tcg/common/common.h
and rebuild the testsuite.

To build and run the testsuite:

Standalone:
	1) cd tcg
	2) make
	3) cd ..
	4) ./tsstests.sh

Integrated with the LTP:
	1) Download and expand LTP
	2) Obtain testcases from CVS (or other package).
	3) Copy the tcg directory into <ltp>/testcases
	4) Apply the Makefile patch
	5) make
	6) make install
	7) ./runalltests.sh -f </full/path/to/ltp>/runtest/tcg -l ./logfile -p
